# HR-Dashboard-using-Power-BI

Had a basic touchdown to Power BI

What I learn:

1. Build an attractive and eye-catching HR Dashboard
2. Visualize gender and racial diversity using graphs and charts in Power BI
3. Explore buttons, themes, filters, and slicers to make the dashboard interactive and smart
